# Project-Evaluation
This is a python code which accepts a linguistic opinion i.e good,bad,etc of a evaluated project and gives a crisp grade as output.It performs a test on Evaluator to see if evaluation is fair or not and likewise opinion's percentage of consideration varies.It accepts inputs through web pages(This was designed before I learnt Web Development and are not great looking!) but once done a enter must be pressed on terminal.Output is again displayed on a web page.
All this makes use of XAMPP Localhost.All files must be in Project folder of htdocs.
mydata is a binary file and is present along with python code at home directory.
#Files location are with respect to Ubuntu.
